# Unity Test

Minimalistic third person shooter game evaluating Unity gameplay and UI implementation skills.

## Instructions

*   Carefully read the game specification and the coding standard.

*   Create a **Unity Test** 3D project in **Unity 2017.3**.

*   Import the following assets (and nothing else) :

*   Try to implement as much as you can of this game in maximum two days, preferably in the following order :

    *   The hero animation, overlay, aiming, shooting, impact and death.
    *   The footman/grunt/golem/lich animation, navigation, aiming, attack, impact and death.
    *   The game-lost menu.
    *   The game-won menu.
    *   The game-paused menu.
    *   The game-title screen.
    *   The game-options screen.
    *   The enemy minimap.
    *   The hero aiming IK.
    *   The hero feet IK.
    *   The text localization.

*   Do your best to apply the programming conventions explained in the coding standard document, especially the following rules :
    *   Write types in **UPPER_CASE** : TANK_SHELL.
    *   Write type members in **CamelCase** : Tank.ShootShell().
    *   Write local variables and method parameters in **snake_case** : enemy_index. 
    *   Align braces vertically.
    *   Don't use acronyms, abbreviations or single-letter variables.

*   On the last evening, simply send us back a pack or archive of your work in progress using a file transfer web service like **wetransfer.com** or **transferbigfiles.com**.
